O principal objectivo deste painel é dar aos alunos do L.EIC e do M.EIC uma perspetiva atual sobre o mercado de trabalho em que este curso se insere e desmistificar o início de carreira no setor. Para tal, convidou-se vários ex-alunos de Engenharia Informática na FEUP para que possam partilhar as suas experiências e conselhos numa conversa informal e honesta.
