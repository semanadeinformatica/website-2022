In this talk I will describe the power of using Digital Humans to enhance human communication and connection in a world where the line between physical, real and virtual is becoming more and more interconnected. I will walk the audience through the key artistic and technical components needed to create Digital Humans that look realistic. I will also highlight the challenges and provide a glimpse of the future that Digital Humans unveil. By the end of the session I would expect to have instill in the audience the curiosity needed to think wilde and bold on why Digital Humans are needed.
