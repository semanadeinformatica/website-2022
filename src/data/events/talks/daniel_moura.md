For this talk, I have selected case studies from work that I have done in the past 10 years where data was the centerpiece. Use cases come from different application domains, namely, medical imaging, urban mobility and vehicular communication systems and span from academia research to commercial applications. I will show you how data can help doctors making better diagnostics, help public transport companies improve their efficiency, and help understand the business opportunities of vehicular communication systems.
