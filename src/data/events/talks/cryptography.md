Since the ancient times, cryptography has existed. What started as a journey to disguise communications has now evolved to a single field where security and privacy properties are discussed.

In this talk, we will look at certain topics of cryptography: where did they started and what they are now. We will also look at them from the theory perspective and how they evolved into real-world implementations.
