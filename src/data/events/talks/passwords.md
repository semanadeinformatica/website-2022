    bio: I'm Paulo, and I've used my 15+ years of software development experience to write secure distributed system and open-source libraries for many industries. In the last 7 years, I work as core developer on open source reactive systems libraries that power high-performance systems and frameworks you may use daily. I've implemented one of the first FIDO2 conformant open-source libraries for the JVM and am a true believer and advocate for the use of strong security standards on the JVM.

Passwords can be intercepted, brute-forced, stolen, guessed, phished, logged and are the top cause of security breaches. Software developers can end this trend now.

I'll be talking about how to replace password authentication with secure, phishing proof, passkeys. I'll show you why password authentication should be considered legacy and how passkeys addresses the limitations and promotes the best security practices. Passkeys are a w3.org standard and easy to adapt to new or existing projects.
