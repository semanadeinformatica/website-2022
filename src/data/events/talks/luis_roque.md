The usage of Machine learning by companies around the world has been increasing every year (globally, machine learning jobs are projected to be worth almost \$31 billion by 2024). Yet, the process of research to productization of such models is still a challenge. First of all, there are significant differences between research and production environments. Examples of this separation are the main drivers of the work, how the data is presented, the computational requirements, and the evaluation metrics used to measure success. On top of that, an organization needs to fully understand the trade-offs between accuracy, cost, maintainability, and interpretability. Only then, the company is ready to infuse existing products with ML intelligence or to build ML-first products.
